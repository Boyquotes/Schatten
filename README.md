## Executive Summary
### Game Concept
You play as a kid who's trying to cope with the passing of his parents. You will traverse through your old home in your dreamscape, familiar but now swarmed with monsters, and defeat your inner demons one room at a time.

This is a top-down dungeon crawler similar to Binding of Isaac where the player goes room to room clearing enemies. 

The player will attack enemies using their own shadows, their shadows will be positioned depending on where the player places the light sources in the room.

### Genre
Adventure, action, top-down, hack and slash rpg game.

### Target Audience
Players who enjoy action hack and slash games with a good story.

### Minimum Viable Product (Under-Construction)
- 1 room with objects
- 1 enemy type
- 1 weapon (sword)
- 1 light source
- player can attack the enemy using their shadow, enemy swarm in from edges of room

## Gameplay
### Objectives
As you progress through the game you get closer to the center of the conflict (loss of parents), and you overcome your past. 

The player needs to clear all the rooms, each room will reveal a section of their suppressed memories. By clearing the room, the kid will accept what has happened and regain a part of himself (story only - no effect on gameplay) which he has abandoned. A piece of their memory is collected after each room.

To beat the game, the player needs to clear all the rooms, collecting all pieces of their memory.

### GUI
- health bar
- options menu
  - save
  - volume

## Mechanics
The gameplay will consist of strategic placement of light sources (player uses the shadows generated from lights and combat mechanics (manouvering around enemies). THe player may not progress to the next room until clearing the current room.

Setup Phase: \
Upon entering each room, player will have time to set up light sources to specify the direction of their shadows. The player may then start the wave, and enemies will spawn from the edges of the room and approach the player.

Combat Phase:
- The player attacks the enemy using their shadows 
  - size of shadow depends on distance from the light source - the further away the larger the shadow, but also the less damage dealt
  - player attacks by swinging the sword (has cooldown time), all enemies in the area covered by the sword's shadow will be damaged
- upon player contact with enemies and enemy projectiles, player will lose HP.

Post-Combat:
- an exit will appear/unlock, and the player needs to walk through it


## Environment (Under-Construction)
- each room will be a room in the house, with familiar objects associated with the protagonist's memory. 

- linear room progression - only 1 entrance and 1 exit - exit appears after clearing the room
  - scene transition (fade in fade out)

Room Progression: \
1. bedroom
  - starting area (tutorial), protag. fights teddy bears, toys
2. bathroom 
  - getting ready for the day
  - first room, protagonist fights bubble monsters
3. kitchen - fighting cookie monster
  - cooking, eating
4. garage
  - playing, helping your dad out
5. living room
  - climax of story?


## Storyline Ideas
- rooms + memories to go with the room = environment

- after clearing a room it would remind them with the good memories
- animal spirit will guide the child to the destination
